I want to tell you at this time that I am completely satisfied with the work performed by Done Right. I dealt with Steve more than the fellows who did the gutter work or the paint chap and I would like to commend him on his work ethic and professionalism, along with his workmanship.
-Bob Gerenser

Thanks for the excellent job. All of your roofers were conscientious and did a great job. I will recommend you to those I run across who need roofing work.
-Sheldon Mayes

Your crew did a wonderful job and they were very professional and friendly. Several neighbors (and others walking by) have commented on how good the new roof looks. I have given your name to several of them who have talked about needing a new roof.
-Carol Adams

This is just a note to let you know how pleased I am with the new roof that you put on my house. It is a quality job, and it looks fantastic. Thank you for your knowledge guidance in helping us to select the product and color. Thanks also for your flexibility in working with our contactor and coordinating with everyone to get the job done as quickly as possible, especially during all of that rain! Your roofer was courteous and cooperative and easy to work with and he did fine work. It will be a long time before I need another roof, but when I do, I will certainly come to you!
-Ciro Giammona

I have dealt with many contractors over the years. Some were quite good. Others were not so good. I have never dealt with a more professionally run contracting operation than Done Right Inc. The planning and quotation process was well facilitated and we were able to rapidly make decisions on color, style, cooling fan, insultation and many other issues with your skilled assistance. The job both started and finished on time. the logistics of delivering material and labor went without a hitch. The quality of the finished project is excellent and we are very, very pleased with our new roof, As important, the crew was hard working yet responsive, communicative, fun and just a pleasure to have around. We will miss them. Please thank everyone that helped!
-Bob and Fay Perdriau

Please feel free to use us as a future reference. We are very satisfied that we chose you as the company to handle our roofing project. Your crew members were conscientious, courteous and hard working. The job was well coordinated and organized. We appreciate your concerns for our satisfaction.

*** ESTIMATES ***
--- Estimates ---
We offer professional consultations on green roofing, solar energy, insulation, waterproofing, general carpentry work, and ventilation.

Glenn will usually spend an hour or so with you to help you decide which roof system and/or solar energy system will work for you and answer any questions you may have.

Glenn will inspect eaves for dryrot, existing ventilation and the attic for insulation.

We bring a binder with all of our company information, previous job sites, referrals and roof brochures for you to keep.

Glenn will print out a proposal for you.

Use the contact form to the right if you're interested in receiving an estimate.

*** INSPECTIONS AND PERMITS ***
--- Roof Inspections ---
Done Right, Inc. conducts roof inspections to check for any problems the roof may have and for the approximate life left on the roof. We will give a written report of anything we may find and what should be done to remedy the problem(s) with the approximate cost to repair if needed. By maintaining your roof now, you will increase the roof life by up to 5 years!

We also do this for real estate companies, buyers and/or sellers of property(s) who need an inspection before the purchase or sale of a house.

The cost of an inspection and written report is $125. The reason for the charge is that a roof inspection is an in depth report of your existing roof. We are not there to just measure and give you a cost of a new roof (what you get with a "free" estimate). We are there to hopefully extend the life of your roof with our findings and repair suggestions.

--- Permits ---
Most cities have attached requirements for various code compliance's to the final approval of any permit. Done Right, Inc. will secure the permit(s) as required for re-roofing and/or solar energy system installation and will complete your new roof and solar system so that it will pass all final inspection requirements of the roof itself.

--- Message from the President: ---
"Green is here. We must all do our part to build smarter for the betterment of the planet. We always are looking for ways to increase green. We believe the flat roof can be a green asset with metacrylics. We believe the pitch roof should be better insulated and ventilated to be a green roof."

"Most contractors can use the same materials as us, the difference is, company knowledge, understanding, and willingness to do a good job. We strive to put on the very best roof. We are very aggressive towards our employee's compensation, medical benefits, and vacation pay. Our company maintains a good safety record. We do not put any money towards "buying business" through media advertising such as the phone book, t.v. guide, billboards etc. If you are not satisfied, we will redo the job. Done Right Roofing & Gutters always looks for better ways to do things. Our name says it all."
- Glenn Lenker President/CEO

-----Done Right Roofing is Certified by CertainTeed as a SELECT ShingleMaster-----
Becoming a SELECT ShingleMaster requires several educational and accreditation steps. It separates the best, most qualified and capable companies from the rest. Done Right Roofing has earned CertainTeed's certification by completing the following steps and must continue to meet the qualifications to earn and maintain the credential:

--- The Most Well-Qualified Installers ---
Thorough testing and regular re-accreditation ensure that all supervisors and at least 50% of Done Right's installers are Master Shingle Applicators (MSA's).
Information from the CertainTeed Shingle Applicator's Manual provides instruction to Done Right's MSAs, making us the most knowledgeable roofing installers in the industry.

--- Product Knowledge ---
One or more Done Right employees have earned the Shingle Quality Specialist designation after passing a test on the CertainTeed Shingle Technology Manual, which proves our knowledge of shingle products, quality standards and satisfying customer objectives.
Trust in Done Right MSA's expertise to explain important differences between shingles and offer an appropriate selection of products for your roof.

--- Insured and Established ---
The SELECT ShingleMaster must carry worker's compensation insurance, as required by law, and liability insurance covering roofing. This coverage is critical for your protection.
Done Right Roofing exceeds CertainTeed's requirement of being in business for a minimum of five years or holding another CertainTeed credential for at least one year.

--- Up-to-Date and Ongoing Credential Requirements ---
CertainTeed keeps records on every SELECT ShingleMaster to ensure the credentials and insurance coverage are current. Feel free to call CertainTeed at 800-782-8777 to ask about a Done Right's credential status or look us up on the find a pro section here

Save significantly on your electric and/or gas utility expenses.
Add value to your home or business property.
Create a greener image for your neighborhood, and make your home or business stand out from the rest.

--- Why use Done Right for both Solar and Roofing ---
When a solar system is installed there is some disruption to your existing roof. Having an experienced roofing company install your solar system ensures top of the line roofing skills along with installation of the best solar system.

If you are installing a new roof, installing a solar system at the same time makes sense. It is more efficient and there is less disruption than would be the case if each were installed separately. You also start saving money on your utility bills right away.

--- Finance and Save --- 
Because you start saving money on your utility bill immediately, you can use the savings to pay off the cost of your solar system, having it pay for itself each month.
