						<p><span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>I want to tell you at this time that <span class="testify">I am completely satisfied</span> with the work performed by Done Right.

						<p><span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>Thanks for the excellent job. All of your roofers were <span class="testify">conscientious</span> and did a great job. I will recommend you to those I run across who need roofing work.<span class="quotation">&rdquo;</span><br>-Sheldon Mayes</p>

						<p><span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>This is just a note to let you know how pleased I am with the new roof that you put on my house. <span class="testify">It is a quality job that looks fantastic</span>. Thank you for your knowledge and guidance in helping us to select the product and color. Thanks also for your flexibility in working with our contactor and coordinating with everyone to get the job done as quickly as possible, especially during all of that rain! Your roofer was courteous and cooperative and easy to work with and he did fine work. It will be a long time before I need another roof, but when I do, I will certainly come to you!<span class="quotation">&rdquo;</span><br>-Ciro Giammona</p>

						<p><span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>I have dealt with many contractors over the years. Some were quite good. Others were not so good. I have never dealt with a more <span class="testify">professionally ran</span> contracting operation than Done Right Inc. The planning and quotation process was well facilitated and we were able to rapidly make decisions on color, style, cooling fan, insultation and many other issues with your <span class="testify">skilled assistance</span>. The job both started and finished on time. The logistics of delivering material and labor went without a hitch. The quality of the finished project is excellent and we are very, very pleased with our new roof, As important, the crew was hard working yet responsive, communicative, fun and just a pleasure to have around. We will miss them. Please thank everyone that helped!<span class="quotation">&rdquo;</span><br>-The Perdriau Family</p>
